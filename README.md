# INTEGRATING GEO-REFERENCED HISTORICAL INFOMATION


> The need to represent and share information on the Internet has been increasing over the years, with various entities, such as universities, increasingly using repositories to achieve this goal. Not only do these institutions benefit from the use of repositories, but also researchers who have access to this data for their research. But problems do exist, with each repository following its own data format and its own interface, forcing researchers to know each of them to use them. In this Master’s thesis was develop a platform that allows uniform access to historical and cultural heritage data repositories, through an interface that can be integrated by third parties, that, in addition to simplifying the search process in several repositories, converts the results to a common format and detects relationship between them. All of this in order to facilitate the search of information by the researcher.
